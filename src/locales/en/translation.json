  "docIntro": "The Payment4 Payment Gateway is a web-based service designed to facilitate cryptocurrency payments and blockchain transactions for businesses and individuals. It empowers you to integrate blockchain transactions and cryptocurrency payments into your online store and digital services, utilizing the capabilities of Payment4.",
  "transactionTxtOne": "Every transaction follows a defined path from initiation to settlement. The status of each transaction is meticulously recorded at every stage, allowing for real-time tracking through the merchant system. A unique token is assigned to each transaction, granting access to its details. Transaction status is separately displayed in the table below, and in Payment4's data models, it is represented as the 'status.'",
  "transactionTxtTwo": "Testing and Sandbox Environment : Before going live with real transactions, we encourage you to test your Transactions in a sandbox environment. This allows you to simulate transactions and ensure that everything works as expected. You can access our sandbox environment by instructions on how to access the sandbox environment.",
  "settlements": "Merchants have the flexibility to choose which cryptocurrencies they accept, including popular options like BTC and ETH. For each cryptocurrency, they must provide an address to receive the funds. Notably, Payment4 does not hold funds from the merchant's customers. After each payment, the full amount, minus the transaction fee, is promptly transferred to the merchant's predetermined receiving address.",
  "systemLimitOne": "Global Minimum Transaction Amount Limit: Payment4 enforces a global minimum transaction amount of $5, irrespective of the chosen cryptocurrency (BTC, ETH, etc.). Transactions with amounts less than $5 will be rejected.",
  "systemLimitTwo": "Rate Limits and Usage Policies: Payment4 may have rate limits on API usage to ensure fair and efficient utilization of our services. Please refer to our API documentation for detailed rate limit information and usage policies.",
  "apiKey": "To utilize the Payment4 web gateway and API services, merchants are required to create an API key. This key serves as the bridge between their systems and Payment4's services.",
  "security": "Payment4 prioritizes the security of your transactions and customer data. We employ robust security measures to safeguard your business and your customers. All communication with Payment4 is encrypted using industry-standard protocols to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of your data. Authentication is a critical aspect of our system. Merchants are required to use an API key when making requests to our API. This key serves as a secure identifier to authenticate your requests, preventing unauthorized access. For additional security, we also offer optional two-factor authentication (2FA) to add an extra layer of protection to your account. We strongly encourage merchants to enable 2FA for enhanced security.",
  "apiDoc": "Merchants can use the API to initiate transactions by specifying the 'coin,' 'fiat amount,' and other relevant details. Payment4 generates a wallet address for the transaction, calculates the required cryptocurrency amount for the payment, and sends this information back to the merchant. Merchants must then display the generated address and amount to their customers, monitoring the transaction status with Payment4. When customers pay the specified amount to the address, Payment4 responds with a 'success' status. In this API-based method, merchants are responsible for implementing the payment procedures on their websites or apps, while Payment4 handles the blockchain-related processes.",

In the provided example, it includes a key-value pair, 'your_key' with the value 'your value.' Merchants can customize this as needed to include relevant data for their internal processing.",
  "webhookUrlCreatePayment": "webhookUrl : Similar to the callback URL, this is the URL where Payment4 will send webhook notifications, which can be used for more real-time updates or automation. In the example, 'https://your-domain/payment/webhook/' is a placeholder, and merchants should replace it with their actual webhook URL.",
  "webhookParamsCreatePayment": "webhookParams : Just like the callbackParams, this object allows merchants to send additional parameters along with the webhook notification. In the example, it includes a key-value pair 'your_key' with the value 'your value.'
